Storybored is a simple storyboarding application, where a user can upload creative assets and organize/save them on project boards. 

This app is built with a Flask/Python/Postgres backend, and a React front-end. 

### About me
I'm Camilla. I'm a full-time software engineering student at Hackbright Academy. This is my main project for the course.

I'm coming to Hackbright from 5 years as a developer, team lead and product manager at Mapbox. I'm heading back towards engineering because I love building things. I have some experience on the backend (Python, Bash, AWS), and am using this time to stretch my muslces and brain on a data-driven front-end.

Wish me luck! ðŸ¤˜
